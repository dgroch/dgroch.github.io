## Who am I?

I've worked as a banker, lawyer, software engineer, product manager and marketing leader... the only way I know how to answer the question "*what do you do?*" is "*whatever moves me, whatever gets me passionate*".

## What is this site all about?

This site is the home for my personal musings, reflections and contemporaneous commentary on the projects I'm currently working on. I use it as a way to flesh out thinking about my goals and the challenges I'm facing. Writing brings me clarity. It helps me figure out my own thinking.
