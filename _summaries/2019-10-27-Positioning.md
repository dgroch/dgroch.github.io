## Introduction

"*Positioning*" is the first body of thought to come to grips with the problems of communicating in an over-communicated society.

Today, communication itself is the problem. Each year we send more and receive less.

Positioning is not what you do to or even with a product. Positioning is what you do with the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.

## 1. What Positioning Is All About

The basic approach to positioning is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what's already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist.

The mind has a defence against the volume of today's communications. In general, the mind accepts only that which matches prior knowledge or experience.

The average person will listen when being told something he/she knows nothing about -- this is why "*news*" is an effective advertising approach. But the average person can't tolerate being told he/she is wrong.

In communication, as in architecture, less is more. You have to sharpen your message to cut into the mind.

In positioning, you look for the solution inside the prospects mind> You concentrate the perceptions of the prospect. Not the reality of the product.

## 2. The Assault on the Mind

Our extravagant ues of communication to solve a host of business and social problems has so jammed our channels that only a tiny fraction of all messages actually get through.

We have witnessed an explosion in:
* Media
* Products
* Advertising

In communication, more is less. The only way to cut through is with simplicity.

## 3. Getting into the Mind

The easy way to get into a person's mind is to be first.

The first thing you need to do to "*fix your message indelibly in the mind*" is not a message at all. It's a mind. An innocent mind that has not been burnished by someone elses brand. What matters most is receptivity.

"*Every advertisement is a long-term investment in the image of a brand*" -- David Ogilvy

To succeed in our overcommunicated society, a company must create a position in the prospect's mind that takes into account not only a company's own strengths and weaknesses, but those of its competitors as well.

Strategy is king.

One roadway to success is to look at what your competitors are doing and then subtract the poetry or creativity which has become a barrier to getting the message into the mind. Witha  purified and simplified message, you can then penetrate the prospect's mind.

**Examples**

"*First class is Michelob*" -- positioning Michelob as the premium-priced American made beer

"*You've tasted the German beer that's the most popular in America. Now taste the German beer that's most popular in Germany.*" -- positioning Beck's as the only genuine imported German beer.
