## Introduction

"*Positioning*" is the first body of thought to come to grips with the problems of communicating in an over-communicated society.

Today, communication itself is the problem. Each year we send more and receive less.

Positioning is not what you do to or even with a product. Positioning is what you do with the mind of the prospect. That is, you position the product in the mind of the prospect.
