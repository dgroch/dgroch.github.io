## Introduction

Al Ries and Jack Trout, two successful marketing strategists, call upon over forty years of marketing expertise to identify the definitive rules that govern the world of marketing.

---

## 1. The Law of Leadership

> "It's better to be first than it is to be better."

Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not a battle of products.

The basic issue in marketing is creating a category you can be first in.

It's much easier to get into the mind first than to try and convince someone you have a better product than the one that did get there first.

One reason the first brand tends to maintain leadership is the name becomes generic.

People believe the first product to mind is superior.

---

## 2. The Law of Category

> "If you can't be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in."

If you didn't get into the prospects mind first, don't give up hope.

When you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not "How is this new product better than the competition?" but "First what?". In other words, what category is the new product first in?

For example, Charles Schwab didn't open a better brokerage firm. He opened the first **discount broker**.

Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands; forget brand, think categories. Prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what's new, few are interested in what's better.

When you are first in a new category, promote the category not the brand.

---

## 3. The Law of Mind

> "It's better to be first in the mind than first in the marketplace."

The *Law of Mind* modifies *The Law of Leadership*.

Being first in the mind is everything in marketing. Being first to market is important only to the extent it allows you to get in the mind first.

You can't change a mind once it is made up. The single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is try to change a mind.

You have to blast your way into a persons mind; you can't worm your way in then slowly build up a favourable impression.

The reason you have to blast instead of worm is that people rarely, if ever, change their minds.

---

## 4. The Law of Perception

> "Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of perceptions."

There are no objective facts.

There are no best products.

Perception is reality, everything else is an illusion.

All the exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in the mind of prospects.

Marketing is the manipulation of those perceptions to influence the timing and composition of demand.

A perception that exists in the mind is often interpreted as a **universal truth**. People are seldom, if ever, wrong. At least in their own minds.

For example, Honda is perceived in America to be a manufacturer of reliable (Japanese) cars. In Japan, however, Honda is perceived to be a successful maker of motorcycles; the company is a distant third to Toyota and Nissan when it comes to car sales.

The **"everybody knows"** principle makes the battle even more difficult; prospects frequently make buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions.

---

## 5. The Law of Focus

> "The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect's mind."

Simple words are best, taken right out of the dictionary.

It's the ultimate marketing sacrifice.

For example, Federal Express was able to put the word *overnight* into the minds of its prospects because it sacrificed its product line and focused on overnight package delivery only.

The leader owns the word that represents the category. In the toothpaste category, for example, the company that owns be "fresh" or "white" is likely to be the leader.

The most effective words are simple and benefit oriented.

It's always better to focus on one word or benefit rather than two, three or four.

If you strongly establish one benefit, the prospect is likely to assign you related benefits.

Words can be:
* benefit related
* service related
* audience related
* sales related

You can't take someone else's word.

The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. YOU become stronger when you reduce the scope of your operations. You can't stand for something if you chase everything.

---

## 6. The Law of Exclusivity

> "Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect's mind"

Remember, you can't change prospect's minds once they are made up. If a competitor already owns a word in the prospect's mind don't challenge them, choose a different word.

---

## 7. The Law of the Ladder

> "The strategy to use depends on which run you occupy on the ladder"

Strategies do exist for No. 2 and No. 3 brands.

In each category there is a product ladder in the prospect's mind. On each rung is a brand name.

For example, Avis excelled when it admitted it's role as No. 2 in car rentals. Avis famously ran the campaign tagline "*Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars. So why go with us? We try harder"*

The mind is selective. Prospects use their ladders in deciding which information to accept and which information to reject. In general, a mind only admits new information which is consistent with existing beliefs.

How many rungs on a category ladder? It depends on the product. If the product is used daily there tends to be many rungs (word opportunities); however, products which are purchased infrequently are low-interest and are likely to have fewer rungs.

A relationship exists between your rung on the ladder and market share. Each next rung on the ladder typically has half the market share of the rung preceding it.

What's the maximum number of rungs on a ladder? There appears to be a rule of seven in the prospect's mind.

---

## 8. The Law of Duality

> "In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race."

A category typically becomes a titanic struggle between two major playersâ€”usually the old reliable brand and the challenger.

Successful marketers focus on holding one of the top two rungs on the ladder. Jack Welch, the celebrated CEO of GE, famously required GE to exit every business in which they were not ranked 1 or 2. Poorly ranked businesses were fixed, closed or sold.

In a new and growing market, the volume of sales going to companies ranked 3 and 4 can look attractive. However, over time as customers become more educate they gravitate toward the leading band, believing that if it's the leading brand it must be better.

Remember, marketing is a battle of perceptions not products. It's this kind of thinking that keeps two brands on top: "They must be the best, they're the leaders."

---

## 9. The Law of Opposite

> "If you're shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leaders."

In strength there is weakness. Wherever the learning band is strong, there's an opportunity for a would-be No. 2 brand to turn the tables.

The strategy for challenger (No. 2) brands must determine the essence of the leading brand and present the prospect with the opposite.

Don't try to be better, be different.

Positioning yourself against the leader, you take business always from all other alternatives to No. 1

For example, consider how the *Pepsi Generation* took on *the real thing*, Coca-Cola.

Hone on a weakness the leading brand will quickly acknowledge (because it is their core strength), then twist the knife. For example, challenger brand Scope attacked the "medicine breath" perception of leading brand Listerine. It's campaign tagline was "*Scope, the good tasting mouthwash that kills germs*."

Marketing is often a battle for legitimacy. The first brand to capture a concept can cast competitor's as illegitimate.

#### Notable campaign taglines:
* "You've tasted the German beer that's most popular in America. Now taste the German beer that's most popular in Germany." (Becks vs Heineken)
* "For the millions who should not take Aspirin" (Tylenol vs Aspirin)
* "Have it your way" (Burger King vs McDonald's)

---

## 10. The Law of Division

> "Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories."

A category starts off as a single entity. Computers, for example. But over time, the category breaks up into other segments. Mainframes, minicomputers, desktop computers, laptops, iPad, etc.

Each new category has a reason for existence, and it's No. 1 leading brand.

"*Synergy*" is the antithesis of the Law of Division. Categories are dividing, not combining.

The way for a category leader to maintain it's dominance is to address each emerging category with a new brand name. For example, General Motors grew through acquisition and maintained a decentralized management structure under Alfred Sloan. Each brand (eg. Chevrolet) occupied a distinct rung in the market.

---

## 11. The Law of Perspective

> "Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time."

In marketing, long-term effects are often exactly opposite to short-term effects.

For example, coupons and discounting provide a short-term spike in sales but over the long-term prospects are taught to hold out for lower prices. "*Line extension*" (the topic of `Law #12`) is another example of divergence between short-term and long-term consequences. In the short-term, line extensions may cause a spike in total sales. But over time the equity of the extended brand is diluted and decline sets in.

Investor Ray Dalio refers to these as the **first order** and **second order** consequences of decisions. The first order consequence of exercise is pain/discomfort (bad) and the second order consequence is improved health and reduced bodyweight (good).

Research by beauty brand Dove suggests powerful 60% / 40% allocation between master brand building and product promotion is a good strategy for building brand dominance in a category. 

---

## 12. The Law of Line Extension

> "There's an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand."

By far the most frequently transgressed law of marketing.

Line extension involves taking the name of a successful product and applying it to a new and different product you plan to introduce. It is done to transfer equity from the successful brand to the unproven new brand, but in the long run it's a parasitic strategy that kills the host.

When a brand possesses the No. 1 position in a category, the name is frequently used as a substitute for the category. Take Kraft and it's *Philadelphia* brand of cream cheese. It's not uncommon to hear someone say, "*can you pass the Philly please?*".

**Less is more**. If you want to be successful in today's over- communicated and saturated market, you have to narrow the focus in order to build a position in the prospect's mind.

When you try to be all things to all people, you inevitably end up in trouble. "*I'd rather be strong somewhere*", said one manager, "*than weak everywhere.*"

Military strategist Carl von Clausewitz predicted this line of thinking in the 18th Century. In **Principles of War**, Clausewitz advised:

"*We must select for our attack one point of the enemy's position and attack it with great superiority, leaving the rest of his army in uncertainty but keeping it occupied... Even though we are strong, we should still direct our main attack against one point only. In that way we shall gain more strength at this point. For to surround an enemy completely is possible only in rare cases and requires tremendous physical or moral superiority*"

---

## 13. The Law of Sacrifice

> "You have to give up something in order to get something."

If you want to be successful today, you should give something up (ie. get more focused). See also *Laws #5 and #12*.

There are three things to sacrifice:
1. product line (eg. Apple in 1990s when Steve Jobs returned)
2. target market (eg. Pepsi ignoring everyone except teenagers)
3. constant change (eg. Bunnings TV ads work and never change)

A wider net might cash more fish... but it doesn't catch more customers. Marketing is a game of mental warfare and the only way to win is to own a word association in the mind of the customer.

Remember, the target is not the market. Even though Pepsi's target was the teenager, the market was everybody. The 59-year-old guy who wants to think he's 29 will drink Pepsi.

---

## 14. The Law of Attributes

> "For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute"

Remember, you can't own a position that your competitor already owns (refer to Law #6).

If you need to move on to a lesser attribute, because the most valued attribute is already taken, your task is to dramatize the value of your chosen attribute and thus increase market share.

You can't predict the size of a new attribute's market share, so never laugh. For example, "small" was an attribute that emerged in the "computers" category. Eventually small came to dominate, but then it was arguably overtaken by "mobile" (ie. portable).

Another example is McDonald's vs Burger King. McDonald's owns the junior market (ie. kids). Burger King could position itself for adults and thus hang the "kiddieland" moniker on McDonald's (refer to *The Law of Opposite*). Maybe Burger King's tagline would be "*Grow up to the taste of a flame grilled Whopper*."

---

## 15. The Law of Candor

> "When you admit a negative, the prospect gives you a positive."

For example, "*The taste you hate twice a day*" (Listerine) setup the selling idea that it must kill a lot of germs (the prospect figured, if it tastes like disinfectant it must kill a lot of germs).

Every negative statement you make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth. On the other hand, positive statements are looked at dubiously (at best).

Marketing is often a search for the obvious. Since you can't change a mind once it's made up, your marketing efforts have to be devoted to using ideas and concepts already installed in the brain.

Admitting a problem is something very few companies do; remember, don't be better be diffferent.

Keep in mind two practical directions:
1. The negative must be generally perceived as a negative; and
2. Shift swiftly to the positive

---

## 16. The Law of Singularity

> "In each situation, only one move will produce substantial results."

Trying harder is not the secret of marketing success. The only thing that works in marketing is the single, bold stroke.

Successful generals study the battleground and look for that one bold stroke that is least expected by the enemy ("*the line of least expectation*")

Most often there is only one place where your competitor is vulnerable; that place should be the focal point of all your marketing efforts.

---

## 17. The Law of Unpredictability

> "Unless you write your competitor's plans, you can't predict the future"

No one can accurately predict the weather three days in advance, how can they predict a market three years in advance?

Good short-term planning is coming up with that angle or word that differentiates your product or company. Then you setup a coherent long-term marketing direction that builds a program to maximise that idea or angle. It's not a long-term plan, it's a long-term direction.

Two common forecasting mistakes are estimating no change (the future will be like the present) or extrapolating too much (growth rates will continue).

Research helps you measure the past, not the future. New ideas and concepts are almost impossible to measure. No one has a frame of reference. People don't know what they will do until they face an actual decision.

One way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build enormous flexibility into your organization.

There's a difference between *predicting* the future and *taking a chance* on the future.

---

## 18. The Law of Success

> "Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance to failure"

When people become successful they become less objective. Often they substitute their own judgment for what the market wants.

Brilliant marketers can think like a prospect thinks. They put themselves in the shows of their customers. They don't impose their own view of the world on the situation.

Like kings, chief executives rarely get honest opinions from their ministers. One strategy to combat this tendency is to visit the operations unannounced, or go in disguise.

---

## 19. The Law of Failure

> "Failure is to be expected and accepted"

Recognize failure early and cut your losses. Companies that excel (compared to their peers) embrace inconvenient truths, deal with them and embrace change.

"Ready, fire, aim"

Risk aversion is rife, particularly in large organizations where people have much more to lose (status, comfortable salaries, etc). Why? Because nobody ever got fired for a bold move they didn't make.

Personal agendas are also problematic. In some companies a great idea is rejected not because it isn't fundamentally sound but because no one in senior management will personally benefit from its success.

The solution? Champion people who take risks and embrace "a better way".

---

## 20. The Law of Hype

> "The situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press"

When things are going well, the company doesn't need the hype. When you need the hype, usually it means you're in trouble.

Once the hype starts if often continues on-and-on, it has a life of its own for at least a while.

Capturing the imagination of the public is not the same as revolutionizing a market.

Real revolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and kind of sneak up on you.

---

## 21. The Law of Acceleration

> "Successful programs are not built on fads, they're built on trends"

A fad is a wave in the ocean, a trend is the tide. Like the tide, a trend is almost invisible but it's very powerful over the long-term.

A fashion is a fade that repeats itself.

Here's the paradox. When faced with a rapidly rising business, with all the characteristics of a fad, the best thing you could do is dampen the fad. By dampening the fad, you stretch it out and it becomes more like a trend.

For example, successful entertainers control their appearances. They don't wear out their welcome.

The best, most profitable thing to ride in marketing is a long-term trend.

---

## 22. The Law of Resources

> "Without adequate funding an idea won't get off the ground"

Marketing is a game fought in the mind of the prospect. You need money to get into a mind. And you need money to stay in the mind once you get there.

Ideas without money are worthless.

In war, the military always errs on the high side. Why? You can't save your way to success.
