## Introduction

Al Ries and Jack Trout, two successful marketing strategists, call upon over forty years of marketing expertise to identify the definitive rules that govern the world of marketing.

## 1. The Law of Leadership

> "It's better to be first than it is to be better."

Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not a battle of products.

The basic issue in marketing is creating a category you can be first in.

It's much easier to get into the mind first than to try and convince someone you have a better product than the one that did get there first.

One reason the first brand tends to maintain leadership is the name becomes generic.

People believe the first product to mind is superior.

> "If you can't be first in a category, set up a new category yo ucan be first in."
